Project Title: AI-Enhanced Customer Support Ticket
 Resolution and Proactive Issue Prevention System
 Project Statement:
 This project aims to develop an advanced AI-powered customer support system that
 leverages historical ticket data analysis to predict recurring issues and proactively
 address potential concerns. By integrating LLMs like OpenAI GPT, Meta LLaMA for
 natural language processing and sentiment analysis with Google Sheets, Slack, and
 Email, the system will automate responses to common issues, escalate high-priority
 tickets based on sentiment and urgency, and provide preemptive solutions. This
 solution will significantly enhance customer support efficiency, reduce response
 times, and improve overall customer satisfaction by addressing issues before they
 escalate.
 Outcomes:
 ● Predictive issue detection and automated solution generation for recurring
 support problems.
 ● Real-time sentiment-based ticket escalation for priority handling of
 high-stress situations.
 ● Automatedresolution system for common issues, integrated with multiple
 communication platforms.
 ● Significant reduction in support ticket volume and improved first-contact
 resolution rates.
 Modules to be Implemented:
 1. Historical Analysis and Recurrence Detection Engine
 ● Analyzes past ticket data to identify patterns and predict future issues.
 ● Generates preemptive solutions for commonly recurring problems.
 2. Real-Time Sentiment Analysis and Escalation System
 ● Monitors incoming tickets for urgency and customer sentiment.
 ● Automatically flags and routes high-priority tickets for immediate
 attention.
 3. Automated Response and Resolution Hub
 ● Drafts responses for repetitive issues using AI-generated content.
 ● Integrates with Slack for seamless communication.
 4. Proactive Issue Prevention Dashboard
 ● Provides insights on potential future issues based on historical data.
 ● Suggestsproactive measures to prevent common problems.
Milestones:
 Milestone 1: Weeks 1-2
 Introduction & Initial Training
 Objective: Set up the project infrastructure, introduce team members to the tools
 (LLMs like OpenAI GPT, Meta LLaMA), and gather initial data for training models.
 Tasks:
 ● Setuptheenvironment for ticket data analysis (e.g., integration with Google
 Sheets).
 ● Train team membersonusing LLMsfor ticket analysis and sentiment
 detection.
 ● Begincollecting initial data from historical customer support tickets.
 Milestone 2: Weeks 3-4
 Module 1: Historical Analysis & Recurrence Detection Engine
 Objective: Build a system that analyzes past ticket data to predict recurring issues
 and generate preemptive solutions.
 Tasks:
 ● Implement algorithms to analyze historical support tickets for patterns of
 recurring issues.
 ● Developasystem that generates automated solutions for commonly recurring
 problems.
 Milestone 3: Weeks 5-6
 Module 2 &3: Real-Time Sentiment Analysis & Automated Response Hub
 Objective: Develop a system that monitors incoming tickets for sentiment shifts
 while automating responses to common issues.
 Tasks:
 ● Implement real-time sentiment analysis using LLMs (OpenAI GPT, Meta
 LLaMA) to flag high-priority tickets.
 ● Build anautomated response hub that drafts replies for repetitive issues using
 AI-generated content.
 Milestone 4: Weeks 7-8
 Module 4: Proactive Issue Prevention Dashboard Deployment
 Objective: Provide real-time insights into potential future issues through an
 integrated dashboard synced with communication platforms (Slack & Email).
 Tasks:
● Deployadashboard that provides insights on potential future issues based on
 historical data using data visualization libraries like ‘matplotlib’ or ‘seaborn’
 etc.
 ● Integrate the system with Slack & Email to notify staff about proactive
 measures needed to prevent common problems.
 Evaluation Criteria:
 ● Milestone 1 Evaluation (Week 2): Successful setup of the project environment,
 initial training completed, and first batch of historical ticket data collected for
 analysis.
 ● Milestone 2 Evaluation (Week 4): Historical analysis engine deployed;
 recurring issues identified with preemptive solutions generated.
 ● Milestone 3 Evaluation (Week 6): Real-time sentiment analysis implemented;
 automated response hub deployed with AI-generated replies for common
 issues.
 ● Milestone 4 Evaluation (Week 8): Proactive issue prevention dashboard
 deployed; real-time insights provided on potential future problems along with
 notifications sent via Slack/Email
